## Introduction 
The "novelCoViD" R package allows users to obtain live worldwide data from the
novel CoronaVirus Disease, CoViD-19, as published by the
Johns Hopkins University data repository on Github, as well as, provide basic map and plot functions to investigate these datasets.

The goal of this package is to make the latest data promptly available for anyone how wants to
know more about number of death and confirmed cases of covid19 in any country in the world and 
obtain some visualized sight from this data.

### Data Accessibility
The `Covid19Data()` function allows users to obtain realtime data about the CoViD19 reported cases from the Johns Hopkins University data repository. this function provide a clean data of total and daily death and confirmed cases for every country, available scince 2020-01-22.

### visualizing data on the World map 
The `Covid19onMap()` function provide a world map that the color of every country shows number of new cases of confirmed or death from covid19 on the given date. Entries of this function are data set provided by Covid19Data() function (or the defult is local_data which is the old version of covid19 data, that is stored in the package), a specific date and the type of "confirmed" or "death" to show on the map.

### plot new cases as a function of time for the given country
The 'Covid19Plot()' function plot number of new cases of confirmed and death from covid19 as a function of time for the given country or countries. Entries of this function are data set provided by Covid19Data() function (or the defult is local_data which is the old version of covid19 data, that is stored in the package), a user defined countries, the start date and the end date of user defined time interval.


## Installation

You can install the released version of novelCoViD from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("novelCoViD")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("??????????")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(novelCoViD)
## get new data
newdata <- Covid19Data()
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# map the data for new cases for a given date
Covid19onMap(newdata, "2020-05-24", "confirmed")
```

```{r}
# plot the data as a function of time for any country
Covid19Plot(newdata,"Iran",start_date="2020-01-22",end_date = "2020-10-24")
```


```{r}
# plot the data as a function of time for some countries
Covid19Plot(newdata,country=c("Iran","india"),start_date="2020/02/22",end_date = "2020/05/15")
```



What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
